# God Eater Burst Utils

Not gonna lie, this project is very old and I don't think it will be any useful for new GEB games but... who knows?
Maybe one day I'll come back to the scene and I realize their new file structure isn't changed that much and I can simply re-adapt this one.
I'm uploading it on GitHub after such a long time just to make sure I don't lose it if I swap drives or something like that. Just don't judge it, I was 16 y/o when I wrote this.
